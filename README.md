# Resistor Colour

From Exercism Python track, and working towards #100daysofcode

## Instructions

Resistors are electronic components used to limit the current in part of a circuit as well as controlling the amoiunt of voltage provided to a part of a circuit. 

Having too much current pass through a circuit can destroy sensitive components. 

To limit the current, a resistor is placed at the input of a sensitive part. Limiting the current too much means that the part we are trying to get the current to might not have enough electricity to function.
